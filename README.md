steps for calculator:
1. Set Up Python Environment
Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from python.org.

Open your preferred IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).

2. Plan the Calculator
Decide the type of calculator (e.g., basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Prepare functions for each operation.

3. Write the Basic Code
Start by defining functions for mathematical operations:

python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b != 0:
        return a / b
    else:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
Display a menu for the user to choose an operation.
4. Implement the Logic
Use a while loop for continuous calculation or exit the program based on user input.

Collect numbers and the operation from the user.
5. Test Your Calculator
Run the program, test all operations, and fix any bugs or errors.

6. Enhancements
Add error handling for invalid inputs.

Implement advanced operations like square roots, power functions, or trigonometry (using the math module).
